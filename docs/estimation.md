|Points | Relative Size | Description | Approximate time* |
|--|--|--|--|
1   | xs | This is a trivial change with clearly defined parameters. | < 1 hour
2   | s  | This is a small change with clearly defined parameters.   | < 1 day
3	| m  | This is a small change, but there's some uncertainty. | < 1 week
5	| l  | Moderately complex, will require some effort but clearly defined. | > 1 week
8	| xl | Moderately complex, medium effort, some uncertainty. | > 1 month
13	| xxl| Complex, large effort, well defined (these should be broken down further) | > 1 Quarter
21 | ∞  | Meta issue or We do not have clear scope. (This issue must be broken down) | ∞

* "Approximate time" should **NOT** be used as anything other than a rough estimate for the amount of work.
