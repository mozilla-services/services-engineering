# services-engineering

This is a meta repo for all things related to the Services Engineering team that don't belong specifically to another repo.

## How we work:
* We follow these [Rust best practices](https://github.com/mozilla-services/websec-check/blob/master/rust.md) within our Rust based projects.
* We use [this estimation guide](https://github.com/mozilla-services/services-engineering/blob/master/docs/estimation.md) when adding estimates to tasks. You can see these estimates used as labels throughout our GitHub repos.
* You can usually get a sense of what we're up to on our [our GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/mozilla-services/projects/10).
